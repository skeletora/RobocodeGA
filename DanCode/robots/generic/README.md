# The Generic Robot 

This is a simple generic bot that executes the gene.    This robot relies on a java property (ROBOT_GENE) for its configuration.

Java properties appear to be the java equivelent to command line arguments.

Change the code in this directory to modify the robot.  The supplied makefile will put a  copy of the "executable" in the robots directory.
