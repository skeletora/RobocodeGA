This is the code you should change to change the generic bot.


**** Semi outdated note information ****

This can, and probably will change.

The input format is:
key:key:key

For move
move-mode,min-distance, max-distance, min-angle,max-angle, percent chance to move

Move Mode is 0 for move and turn
             1 for move or turn

Chance to move is only used in mode 1.
